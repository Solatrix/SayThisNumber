#Say This Number
Parses numbers to a human language.

##Usage
Install necessary libraries with `npm install`.

Run `node index.js` and go to `127.0.0.1:8000`, a basic page with instructions is there. The service also supports a basic curl POST API.

##Adding New Languages
1. Write your number parser and expose the function `parseNumber` which recieves a number and returns the number parsed in that language. Make sure to support negative numbers in the new language.
2. Add the language to the `parsers` object in `numberDictionary.js` with the [your language] name as the key and `require('./parsers/[your language]')` as the value.
3. Restart the server and try it out by going to `127.0.0.1:8000/[your langauge]/123`!
